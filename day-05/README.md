# 🧮 Insertion Sort in Java

This Java program demonstrates the **Insertion Sort** algorithm using a simple integer array.

## 📌 What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's much like sorting playing cards in your hands—one card at a time into the correct position.

### 🕹️ How it works:
- Start from the second element.
- Compare it with elements before.
- Shift elements if they're greater than the current element (called `key`).
- Insert the `key` in its correct position.

## 💡 Example Input

```java
int arr[] = {4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 8, 4, 3};
