# ðŸ§© Merge Sort in Java

This repository contains a simple Java implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Merge Sort?

**Merge Sort** is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that:
1. Divides the array into two halves
2. Recursively sorts each half
3. Merges the sorted halves back together

It is known for its **stable sorting** and **O(n log n)** time complexity.

## ðŸ”¢ Example

## ðŸ§  Merge Sort Logic (Simple Explanation)

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the **divide and conquer** method.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Divide
- Split the array into two halves
- Keep dividing until each subarray has only one element

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Conquer
- Merge the subarrays back together
- While merging, compare the elements and place them in sorted order
