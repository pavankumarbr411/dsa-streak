#  Linked List in Java 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Singly Linked List** in Java where the user can input the number of elements and their values at runtime.  
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Next Pointer**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory and can grow/shrink dynamically.
