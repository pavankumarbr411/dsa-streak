# Day 01 - Linear Search

## Problem
Implement Linear Search to find the index of a target element in a given array.

## Solution
Linear search checks each element of the array one by one until the target is found or the array ends.

### Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Code
See `LinearSearch.java` for the implementation.

## Sample Output
