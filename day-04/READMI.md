# 🧼 Bubble Sort (Day 04)

This Java program implements the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until the entire array is sorted.

---

## 🧠 How it works (Simple Steps):
1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare it with the next element.
3. If the first is greater, swap them.
4. Repeat this for the entire array.
5. Repeat the process for all passes until no swaps are needed.

## 🧪 Example:
Original: [4, 5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 2]  
Sorted:   [2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9]

## ⏱️ Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n) — (when already sorted, with optimization)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

📦 Space Complexity: O(1)

## ✅ Key Points:
- Simple sorting algorithm
- Not efficient for large data
- Good for learning basics
