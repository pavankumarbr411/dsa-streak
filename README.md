# 📈 DSA Streak

Welcome to my **DSA Streak** repository! 👋  
This is my personal space where I consistently practice **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to grow as a better problem solver, sharpen my logic, — but for becoming a strong programmer overall. 💪

---

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

Coding is like a workout for the brain — the more I solve, the stronger I get. 🧠  
This repository helps me:

- 🚀 Build the habit of **solving at least one DSA problem every day**
- 🛠️ Understand the core concepts behind **data structures and algorithms**
- 💡 Learn different approaches to the same problem
- 📚 Document my solutions with clean code and clear explanations
- 📈 Track my consistency, improvement, and confidence
