# Insertion Sort (Java)

This Java program demonstrates the **Insertion Sort** algorithm.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Takes an unsorted array of integers
- Sorts the array using the **Insertion Sort** technique
- Prints the array before and after sorting

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple Words)

Like sorting playing cards in your hand:
- Take one number at a time
- Compare it with the numbers before it
- Place it in the correct position by shifting larger numbers

## 🧪 Sample Input

## ⏱️ Time Complexity

- **Best Case (Already Sorted):** O(n)  
- **Average Case:** O(n²)  
- **Worst Case (Reverse Sorted):** O(n²)

 In the worst case, each element is compared with all previous elements — that’s why it becomes quadratic (n × n)
